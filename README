SHE_GST (Shear Galaxy Simulations Toolkit)
==========================================

1) Description

This project contains functionality to generate galaxy image simulations. This is separate from OU-SIM's simulations,
as it contains less functionality in order to expedite the process (e.g., it doesn't simulate cosmic rays, and so also
skips the step of detecting them).

2) Installation

This is an Elements project, and can be built, tested, and installed in a supported environment through running:

make
make test
make install

If this is planned to be used with the pipeline runner on a LODEEN instance, it is recommended this be built and
installed in the directory /home/user/Work/Projects/SHE_GST.

3) Dependencies

- Elements build system
- GalSim toolkit version >= 1.5
- SHE_PPT project
- Euclid data model bindings (in a future version)
